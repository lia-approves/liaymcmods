<p>I decided to move my code from my dropbox</p>
<p>tinyurl.com/liaymcmods</p>
<p>to my github.  Other than that, no modifications have been made.</p>

<p>I worked at Galileo Camps, GSQ Sunnyvale location for Summer 2015, Summer 2016, and two weeks of Summer 2017.  I spent about half of that time in the Mod Design with Minecraft major, which uses Youth Digital and Forge mod manager software.  Here's some Java code I wrote for situational camper requests, sort of as an improvised extension to the curriculumm.  There's also a video of the skeeball machine I built off the top of my head in action, before the ball return chute was added, now lost to the elements.
